# Prompt Engineering Lab

The Prompt Engineering Lab serves as an Education and Experimentation Hub provided by The Generative Intelligence Lab @ FAU. Prompt Engineering is a rapidly evolving discipline at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. This lab is designed to help students, researchers, and developers experiment with the art of creating and refining prompts, offering easy-to-follow resources and opportunities to contribute, collaborate, and share their work.

Prompt Engineering has emerged as a critical component in unlocking the full potential of language models such as GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen. As AI systems continue to revolutionize problem-solving, mastering how to guide and optimize these models through effective prompting techniques is essential for cutting-edge research, practical applications, and future innovation.

This lab provides a hands-on learning environment where participants can actively apply their knowledge through Python code, Jupyter notebooks, and practical exercises designed to foster both experimentation and discovery.

Note: first, you need to [Configure your Lab Enviroment](./CONFIG.md)
